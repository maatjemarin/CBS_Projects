Cybersecurity is receiving growing attention both at the Danish and EU levels. Even though the Computer Science domain dominates the field, it has become a business problem as well with growing awareness. Cyber Security is concerned with the practice of defending digital resources and information systems against cyber attacks. Cybersecurity analytics deals with analyzing the data to achieve cyber security objectives. This data could be anything like network traffic data, emails, hosts, server logs etc. Unfortunately, the cybersecurity skills gap is also most severe in the analytics aspects of cybersecurity.

The course will start by providing fundamental basic knowledge of computer networks, networking devices, security issues, cyber security and the need for cyber security. Next, students will be taught various types of cyber-attacks and their prevention. Then, the real scenarios of network security issues and their possible cyber security solutions will be discussed in the class. 

Taking these scenarios as points of departure, the course will introduce cybersecurity analytics and address how cybersecurity analytics can provide advanced and better solutions to protect against cyber threats. During the course, the students will develop analytical skills and abilities to present concrete security solutions to business organizations. The class will mainly focus on the following topics.

Basics of computer networks and design, network devices, IP addressing 
Fundamentals of cryptography and encryptions 
Types of cyber-attacks and how to prevent them
Introduction to Cyber security analytics tools and cybersecurity analytics. 
Application of cybersecurity analytics on real-world case studies and cybersecurity data.
 
This course provides the students with foundations of cybersecurity and cybersecurity analytics with practical hands-on experience to develop skills via industry-specific and open-source security tools.
