This course covers the following topics: 
- Introduction to Python programming language such as programming basics, Boolean algebra, choice, repetition
- Functions, classes, modules, data structures and collections in Python language
- Introduction to Algorithmic Complexity and some simple Algorithms and Data Structures
- Linear Algebra: Vectors, Vector Spaces, Basis
- Matrices, Dimensions,Gaussian Elimination, and Inner Product, Eigenvector
- Elementary probability theory, standard distributions,
- Architectures and platforms for big data processing such Hadoop, Spark, distributed file systems
- Git fundamentals and branching

The project we wrote aimed to show our understanding of these topics. The first part of the project is centered around Orthogonality, for which we created a user interface to simulate and solve a real-life problem. The second part covers Na√Øve Bayes Classifiers, where we utilize the statistical and probabilistic foundation from the course to create three different machine learning models by hand: a Bernoulli classifier, a Multinomial classifier, and a Gaussian Classifier. We programmed these without the use of external machine learning libraries such as SciKitLearn.
