# CBS_Projects
This repository is a collection of the relevant projects I completed during my MSc in Business Administration and Data Science at Copenhagen Business School.

**Foundations of Data Science: Programming and Linear Algebra**
The aim of this project was to show our capabilities of coding in Python and our understanding of linear algebra. The first topic is Orthogonality, for which we created a user interface to simulate and solve a real-life problem. The second topic is Na√Øve Bayes Classifiers, where we utilize the statistical and probabilistic foundation from the course to create three different machine learning models by hand: a Bernoulli classifier, a Multinomial classifier, and a Gaussian Classifier. We programmed these without the use of external machine learning libraries such as SciKitLearn.

**Data Mining, Machine Learning and Deep Learning**
The project will be added in June 2022.

**Natural Language Processing and Text Analytics**
The project will be added in June 2022.

**Predictive Analytics**
The project will be added in June 2022.
