# CBS_Projects
This repository is a collection of the relevant projects I completed during my MSc in Business Administration and Data Science at Copenhagen Business School.

**Foundations of Data Science: Programming and Linear Algebra**
The aim of this project was to show our capabilities of coding in Python and our understanding of linear algebra. The first topic is Orthogonality, for which we created a user interface to simulate and solve a real-life problem. The second topic is Na√Øve Bayes Classifiers, where we utilize the statistical and probabilistic foundation from the course to create three different machine learning models by hand: a Bernoulli classifier, a Multinomial classifier, and a Gaussian Classifier. We programmed these without the use of external machine learning libraries such as SciKitLearn.

**Data Mining, Machine Learning and Deep Learning**
The aim of this project was to show our knowledge of and capabilities in applying different Machine Learning Techniques. For this project we test how the prominent AlexNet architecture can be used to classify damages to agriculture fields. We compared the standard AlexNet architecture with a modified AlexNet architecture and a Random Forest classifier. We trained our models with over 76,000 pictures and deployed pre-processing steps such as using masks, boundaries, normalization, and scaling. 

**Natural Language Processing and Text Analytics**
The aim of this project was to show our knowledge of and capabilities in applying different Natural Language Processing techniques from the Machine Learning domain. For this project we test the performance of four different machine learning models in classifying tweets into one of two categories: emergency tweets or non-emergency tweets. We compare a Naive Bayes Classifier, a Support Vector Machine, a Recurrent Neural Network, and a pretrained BERT model, each of which were trained on 7,613 tweets. Preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stop words removal, and lemmatization were employed in order to make the input fit for use.

**Predictive Analytics**
The project will be added in June 2022.
