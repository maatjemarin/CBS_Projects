This course covers the following topics:

- Basics of Data mining and machine learning
- Strengths and weaknesses of Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms: variance thresholds,Correlation Thresholds, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Linear models for regression such as maximum likelihood, sequential learning, regularized least squares
- Linear models for classification such as linear classification, logistic regression, support vector machines
- Classification models such as probabilistic generative models, probabilistic discriminative models
- Unsupervised learning: clustering, probabilistic clustering, Expectation-Maximization Algorithm.
- Neural Networks: feed-forward neural networks, network training, backpropagation, convolutional neural networks
- Deep Learning: deep feed-forward networks, regularization for deep learning, optimization for training deep models, application of deep learning


The aim of this project was to show our knowledge of and capabilities in applying different Machine Learning Techniques. For this project we test how the prominent AlexNet architecture can be used to classify damages to agriculture fields. We compared the standard AlexNet architecture with a modified AlexNet architecture and a Random Forest classifier. We trained our models with over 76,000 pictures and deployed pre-processing steps such as using masks, boundaries, normalization, and scaling.
